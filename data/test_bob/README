This was a fun activity to test the algorithm with own advisor's image!

These images show Kernel convolution of one of my advisor's images, and reconstruction of a few using 10 PCA Eigen vectors.
Numbers on top of the vectors are the coefficients/weights for linear combination to reconstruct back the original (convolved) image.

Description:

Bob_mug_convolved.png: Original image convolved by a (9x9) 2d Kernel functions: 30 modified Gaussians   
Bob_mug_pca_eigvec.png: 10 PCA Eigen vectors constructed from the 30 images
Bob_mug_pca_eigvec-im6.png: Reconstruction of the 6th image using 10 Eigen vectors. Numbers indicate the coefficients of the linear combination
